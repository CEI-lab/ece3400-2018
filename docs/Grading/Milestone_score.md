# Grading of Milestones
## ECE 3400, Fall 2017

_Milestone 1 will be graded as follows:_

* 2 points: A robot that successfully follows a line.
* 3 points: A robot that successfully traverses a grid in a figure eight.
* Up to 5 points will be given for implementation (related to the robustness of the solution and the speed of the robot)

_Milestone 2 will be graded as follows:_

* 2 points: Robot that successfully circles an arbitrary set of walls (e.g. through right hand wall following)
* 2 points: Robot that successfully avoids other robots
* 2 points: Robot that automatically starts when a 660Hz tone is played (with background noise)
* 4 points: For a demonstration of a robot that automatically starts upon a 660Hz tone, does line tracking, and avoids robots, and walls.
(It would be helpful to 'show' what the robot is thinking, e.g. by adding visual LEDs that indicate when walls/robots have been detected)

_Milestone 3 will be graded as follows:_

TBD
* 4 points: Simulated maze exploration
* 4 points: Real implementation of the maze exploration
* 2 points: The fastest solution will get an added two points

_Milestone 4 will be graded as follows:_

TBD
* 3 points: System that successfully displays the walls in a maze as the robot finds them
* 3 points: System that successfully displays treasures in a maze as the robot finds them
* 2 points: Robot that successfully signals 'done' on the screen when the maze has been mapped
* 2 points: Robot that successfully plays 'done' on the speaker when the maze has been mapped
