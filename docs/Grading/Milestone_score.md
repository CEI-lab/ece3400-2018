# Grading of Milestones
## ECE 3400, Fall 2017

_Milestone 1 will be graded as follows:_

* 2 points: A robot that successfully follows a line.
* 3 points: A robot that successfully traverses a grid in a figure eight.
* Up to 5 points will be given for implementation (related to the robustness of the solution and the speed of the robot)

_Milestone 2 will be graded as follows:_

* 2.5 points (total of 7.5) per different treasure that can be detected and classified
* 2.5 points to autonomously detect walls

_Milestone 3 will be graded as follows:_

* 4 points: Simulated maze exploration
* 4 points: Real implementation of the maze exploration
* 2 points: The fastest solution will get an added two points

_Milestone 4 will be graded as follows:_

* 3 points: System that successfully displays the walls in a maze as the robot finds them
* 3 points: System that successfully displays treasures in a maze as the robot finds them
* 2 points: Robot that successfully signals 'done' on the screen when the maze has been mapped
* 2 points: Robot that successfully plays 'done' on the speaker when the maze has been mapped
