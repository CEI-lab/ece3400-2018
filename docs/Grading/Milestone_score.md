# Grading of Milestones
## ECE 3400, Fall 2018

_Milestone 1 will be graded as follows:_

* 2 points: A robot that successfully follows a line.
* 3 points: A robot that successfully traverses a grid in a figure eight.
* Up to 5 points will be given for implementation (related to the robustness of the solution and the speed of the robot)

_Milestone 2 will be graded as follows:_

* 3 points: Robot that successfully circles an arbitrary set of walls (e.g. through right hand wall following)
* 3 points: Robot that successfully avoids other robots
* 4 points: For a demonstration of a robot that does line tracking, and avoids robots, and walls.
(It would be helpful to 'show' what the robot is thinking, e.g. by adding visual LEDs that indicate when walls/robots have been detected)

_Milestone 3 will be graded as follows:_

* 8 points: Robot capable of maze exploration using DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, or A* (show that your robot can do different maze configurations, we expect at least one of them to be a minimum size of 4x5)
* 2 points: ..if the robot is also able to update the GUI

_Milestone 4 will be graded as follows:_

* 1 points: Robot which can detect when there are/are not treasures
* 4 points: Robot which can successfully distinguish between red and blue treasures
* 5 points: Robot which can successfully distinguish a square, triangle, and diamond shape
