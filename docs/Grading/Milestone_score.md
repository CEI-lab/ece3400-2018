# Grading of Milestones
## ECE 3400, Fall 2017

_Milestone 1 will be graded as follows:_

* 2 points: A robot that successfully follows a line.
* 3 points: A robot that successfully traverses a grid in a figure eight.
* Up to 5 points will be given for implementation (related to the robustness of the solution and the speed of the robot)

_Milestone 2 will be graded as follows:_

* 2 points: Robot that successfully circles an arbitrary set of walls (e.g. through right hand wall following)
* 2 points: Robot that successfully avoids other robots
* 2 points: Robot that automatically starts when a 660Hz tone is played (with background noise)
* 4 points: For a demonstration of a robot that automatically starts upon a 660Hz tone, does line tracking, and avoids robots, and walls.
(It would be helpful to 'show' what the robot is thinking, e.g. by adding visual LEDs that indicate when walls/robots have been detected)

_Milestone 3 will be graded as follows:_

* 5 points: Simulated maze exploration
* 5 points: Robot which successfully transmits all necessary maze information to the screen

_Milestone 4 will be graded as follows:_

* 2 points: Robot which can successfully distinguish between red, green, and blue treasures
* 3 points: Robot which can successfully distinguish a square, triangle, and diamond shape
* 5 points: Real implementation of the maze exploration
