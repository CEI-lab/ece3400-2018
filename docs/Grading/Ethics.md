# Ethics Homework
## ECE 3400, Fall 2018

All teams have to complete an ethics homework by the deadline noted [here](./schedule.html).

As discussed in lecture, please address the Musk/Hawking Open Letter On Autonomous Weapons (https://futureoflife.org/open-letter-autonomous-weapons/), and write an essay (250word minimum) addressing the following topic:

**Do you think this is going to work? Why/why not?**

Try be as concrete as possible. For example, you can use the following key questions to start your conversation.

* Who are the stakeholders?
* Can you implement this in practice?
* How will this implicate IPS research and development?
