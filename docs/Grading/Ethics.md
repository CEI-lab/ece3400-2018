# Ethics Homework
## ECE 3400, Fall 2018

All teams have to complete an ethics homework by the deadline noted [here](../schedule.html). This assignment counts up to 5 points towards the final grade.

As discussed in lecture, please address the [Musk/Hawking Open Letter On Autonomous Weapons](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter-autonomous-weapons/), and hand in a homework addressing the following topic:

**Is "a ban on offensive autonomous weapons beyond meaningful human control" going to work?**

You are welcome to make this homework in any way you desire. Examples include an essay (min 250 words)/cartoon/sketch/video/interpretive dance/song/painting. Here's a great example of a [short story from Team TBD 2017](https://team15ece3400.github.io/EthicsHW/TheAutonomousCar.html). 


Try be as concrete as possible. For example, you can use the following key questions to start your conversation.

* Why will this work? / Why will it not work?
* Can you implement this in practice?
* Who are the stakeholders?
* Who should evaluate new scientific products?
* How will this implicate IPS research and development?
