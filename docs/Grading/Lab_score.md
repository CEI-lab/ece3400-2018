# Grading of Labs
## ECE 3400, Fall 2018

The labs are scored by the TA's Friday on the week after the labs are done. Up to 15 points are given for good solutions and comprehensive documentations, and additional 5 points will be given for clarity and engaging style.

**Delayed solutions will receive 0 score, without exception.** 

In Lab 1 Microcontrollers, the first 15 points are scored by:

* 2 points: Blinking an internal LED
* 2 points: Blinking an external LED
* 2 points: Reading the value of a potentiometer via the serial port
* 2 points: Map the value of the potentiometer to the LED
* 2 points: Map the value of the potentiometer to the servo
* 2 points: Assemble your robot
* 3 points: Driving your robot autonomously

In Lab 2 Analog Circuitry and FFT's, the first 15 points are scored as follows:

* 2 points: Correct FFT analysis for audio
* 2 points: Working amplifier (or active filter) circuit for audio
* 2 points: Distinguish a 660Hz tone from background noise (talking/music)
* 2 points: Correct FFT analysis for IR
* 2 points: Working amplifier (or active filter) circuit for IR
* 2 points: Distinguish a 6.08kHz IR signal from an IR signal at 18kHz
* 3 points: Demonstration of a single system with nicely merged code that can do both IR and audio

In Lab 3 System Integration and Radio Communication, the first 15 points are scored as follows:

* 2 points: Efficient data scheme to store all maze information on an Arduino
* 1 points: Sending maze information wirelessly between Arduino's
* 1 points: Updating the GUI from the base station
* 2 points: Updating the GUI from a virtual robot on a separate Arduino which is wirelessly connected to the base station
* 2 point: Robot starting on a 660Hz tone
* 2 points: Robot starting on a 660Hz tone and exploring the entire maze
* 2 points: Robot that explores, and stops if it sees another robot, but ignores decoys
* 3 points: Robot-to-GUI integration, full exploration and update on the GUI

In Lab 4 FPGA and Vision, the first 15 points are scored as follows:

* 2 points: Arduino-Camera communication (writing the correct registers)
* 3 points: Arduino-FPGA communication (communicating treasure/no treasure + shape and color)
* 2 points: Displaying the contents of an M9K block on the screen
* 3 points: Camera-FPGA communication (downsampling and storing in the M9K buffer)
* 2 points: Displaying the test image on the camera on the screen
* 3 points: Color detection with the FPGA, camera, and Arduino
