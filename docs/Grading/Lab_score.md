# Grading of Labs
## ECE 3400, Fall 2018

The labs are scored by the TA's Friday on the week after the labs are done. Up to 15 points are given for good solutions and comprehensive documentations, and additional 5 points will be given for clarity and engaging style.

**Delayed solutions will receive 0 score, without exception.** 

In Lab 1 Microcontrollers, the first 15 points are scored by:

* 2 points: Blinking an internal LED
* 2 points: Blinking an external LED
* 2 points: Reading the value of a potentiometer via the serial port
* 2 points: Map the value of the potentiometer to the LED
* 2 points: Map the value of the potentiometer to the servo
* 2 points: Assemble your robot
* 3 points: Driving your robot autonomously

In Lab 2 Analog Circuitry and FFT's, the first 15 points are scored by:

* 2 points: Correct FFT analysis for audio
* 2 points: Working amplifier (or active filter) circuit for audio
* 2 points: Distinguish a 660Hz tone from background noise (talking/music)
* 2 points: Correct FFT analysis for IR
* 2 points: Working amplifier (or active filter) circuit for IR
* 2 points: Distinguish a 12kHz IR signal from an IR signal at 7kHz and 17kHz
* 3 points: Nicely merged code

In Lab 3 Radio Communication and Map Drawing, the first 15 points are scored by:

* 2 points: Sending information wirelessly between Arduino's
* 2 points: Sending the entire maze wirelessly
* 3 points: Updating the maze array, dependent only on the updated robot information
* 1 point:
