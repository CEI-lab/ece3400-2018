# Robot Components and Cost

## ECE 3400, fall 2017

Your team has a budget of $100 to use for your robot. Your team must keep a running tally of the cost breakdown and present this number on the website.

The cost breakdown is as follows:

* Line (grayscale) sensors: $3
* IR distance sensors: $7
* Parallax servos: $13
* Basic components (resistors, capacitors, LEDs, Arduino Uno, FPGA, etc.): $0
* 3D printed pieces, laser cut pieces, and milled PCBs: $0
* Used/salvaged parts can be used: you must clear those with the staff and the partsâ€™ list price will also count towards the total available budget. Shipping charges will also count towards your total $100 budget.
* Custom orders: We can buy parts for you, but the cost of the parts plus shipping goes towards your $100 total available budget. Order as soon as possible - it can take up to two weeks for parts to arrive. If you spend your own money to purchase/add components, you will need to provide the receipt to the staff, and the cost will go towards the total available budget. If your team really wants to use ultrasonic sensors, you can, but be warned that it will be tricky to use them appropriately in a maze environment.
