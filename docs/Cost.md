# Robot Components and Cost

## ECE 3400, fall 2017

Your team has a budget of $100 to use for your robot. Your team must keep a running tally of the cost breakdown and present this number on the website.

The cost breakdown is as follows:

* Line (grayscale) sensors: $3
* IR distance sensors: $7
* Camera: $14
* Parallax servos: $13
* Basic components (resistors, capacitors, LEDs, Arduino Uno, FPGA, etc.): $0
* 3D printed pieces, laser cut pieces, and milled PCBs: $0
* Used/salvaged parts can be used: you must clear those with the staff and the partsâ€™ list price will also count towards the total available budget. Shipping charges will also count towards your total $100 budget.
* Custom orders: We have a _limited_ budget to buy additional parts for you. To get non-stocked components, you'll have to first write an email arguing why these parts are needed to the instructor. The instructor will buy the parts; we CANNOT reimburse you. Note that the cost of the parts plus shipping goes towards your $100 total available budget. Order as soon as possible - it can take up to two weeks for parts to arrive.
