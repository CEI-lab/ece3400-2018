# Robot Components and Cost

## ECE 3400, fall 2018

Teams are restricted to build a robot within $100. 

Basic electronics, laser cutter- and 3D printed parts do not count towards this amount. Neither does the FPGA. 

The cost breakdown is as follows:

* Line (grayscale) sensors: $3
* IR distance sensors: $7
* Camera: $14
* Parallax servos: $13
* Arduino Uno: $16 (count only what's mounted on the robot)
* Used/salvaged parts: You can use parts from old robots, provided that you clear it with the staff first. The approximate price of these parts will also count towards the total available budget.
* Custom orders: We have a _limited_ budget to buy additional parts for you. To get non-stocked components, you'll have to first write an email arguing why these parts are needed to the instructor. The instructor will buy the parts; we CANNOT reimburse you. Note that the cost of the parts plus shipping goes towards your $100 total available budget. Order as soon as possible - it can take up to two weeks for parts to arrive.
