SUB-PARTS

SPECIFIC GOALS

### Overview of Tasks

FIX EXAMPLE PROJECT

Both subteams will need one FPGA and one Arduino. Both teams should download the example Quartus project [here](https://github.com/rohern/ece3400/blob/master/lab3/Lab3_template.zip) and modify the top-level module DE0_NANO.v.

We are using a DE0-Nano Development Board. Its documentation can be found here: http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=165&No=593&PartNo=4.

### Documentation
Throughout this lab and ALL labs, remember to document your steps, experiences, and results on your website. Add anything that you think might be useful to the next person doing the lab. This may include helpful notes, code, schematics, diagrams, videos, and documentation of results and challenges of this lab. You will be graded on the thoroughness and readability of these websites. We cannot grade what isn't proven on the website.

Remember, all labs are mandatory; attendance will be taken at every lab. All labs will require you to split into two sub-teams, be sure to note on the website what work is carried out by whom. 

### Procedures

#### Task 1: Camera-to-FPGA

**1. Setup and Calibrate Camera:**

#### Task 2: FPGA-to-Arduino

**1. Make 25MHz clock:**

### Wrap-Up
Keep all circuitry and materials relevant to the robot in your box. Throughout this week all teams will be sharing FPGAs, so do NOT store those in your bins. Also, do not keep USB A/B cables or computer monitors in your box. All other components can be placed back into their appropriate bins.

You should have documented this lab on your website; your documentation should include personal notes, challenges, successes, and applicable diagrams.

Make sure to push all code to your teams GitHub repository before you leave lab.

### Report

The grading will be based entirely upon your documentation and written understanding of the lab, including video-proof that the system is in fact working.
