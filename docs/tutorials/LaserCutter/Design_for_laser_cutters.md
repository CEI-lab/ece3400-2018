## Tips for designing parts for a Laser Cutter

### Drawing Layout

To cut a piece of material in the laser cutter you will need to make a 2D drawing, for example in [AutoCad](./AutoCAD_Tutorial.md). Zero thickness lines (hairlines) will be cut, whereas thicker lines will be rastered onto the material. The latter technique is usually used to make drawings and engravings on a sheet. 

It often makes sense to make the size of the sheet that you are drawing on fit the size of the laser cutter (1x2 feet). That way you can easily get an idea of where things will be cut. Also, be sure to print at a 100% scale if you print to pdf instead of dxl files.

You can set different properties for different colors. For example, you can make the engraving in green, any internal holes in red, and any outline in blue. You can then adjust the settings for each color appropriately, and first raster all the green color, then cut all the red lines, and then cut the blue lines. When the full circumference of a piece has been cut it tends to shift, therefore it is wise to cut the outline after any internal holes so that they don't shift relative to each other.

### Part Design


* The laser cutter burns away material centered on the vector 

+ Under construction
+ Width of the cut
+ Glue!
