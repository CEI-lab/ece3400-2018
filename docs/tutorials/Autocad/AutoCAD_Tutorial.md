# AutoCAD Tutorial
## Uses for AutoCAD
AutoCAD is a CAD (Computer Aided Design) program that allows you to design various mechanical parts. These parts can then be laser cut, 3D printed, or machined.
## Getting Started
### Open up a new drawing file
### Navigating the workspace
You can drag the camera around the workspace by clicking with the middle mouse button and dragging. You can zoom in and out by scrolling up and down on the mousewheel, respectively. In the right-hand corner of the screen, there is a cube with its sides labeled "TOP," "FRONT," "LEFT," "RIGHT," "BACK," and "BOTTOM." This indicates the perspective you are viewing your drawing from. You can click on the edges of the cube to change your perspective and click on a face to snap to that perspective. You can also click and drag on the cube to change the perspective. The cube is also surrounded by a circle with the cardinal directions labeled. This compass is present so that you always know the camera's orientation when viewing the part. You can also snap your view of your part to a direction by clicking on direction.
### Basic tools for drawing
These are some of the most commonly used tools for making basic 2D drawings. Many of these tools may be familiar to those of you who have used other CAD programs, such as Solidworks. Some tools have small arrows next to them, these indicate more options for that tool, which are usually different methods of specifying a shape.
#### Line
Allows you to draw a straight line from  one point to another. You can specify the length of the line.
#### Polyline
Like the line tool but allows you to add curves to the line through the command line. Also allows you to set the angle and length of lines independently.
#### Circle
Draws a circle on the selected point. The centerpoint and radius can be specified
#### Arc
Draws an arc. This tool has many different options for drawing and specifying arcs, such as 3 point arcs and arcs defined by a center and a radius. Choose the option that works best for you.
#### Rectangle/Polygon
#### Move
#### Rotate
#### Erase
#### Copy
#### Mirror
#### Fillet
#### Stretch
#### Scale
#### Array
#### Offset
#### Text
#### Dimension

### Tools for 3D drawings



### Command line
AutoCAD has a command line at the bottom of the workspace. You can use this command line to enter commands or use tools quickly, without having to search for an icon in the tabs. Whenever you use a tool, the command line gives you the name of the command associated with that tool, as well as additional parameters you can specify, such as the diameter of a circle or the angle of a line. To specify one of the parameters, type the letters highlighted in blue and press enter.

### For 3D parts, add the 3D tools tab to your tabs
By default, AutoCAD does not include the 3D tools tab when creating a new drawing file. The 3D tools tab allows you to place 3D objects as well as extrude 2D objects. To add this tab, right click on some empty space on the tab bar, then hover over "Show Tabs." From here click on "3D Tools", which will add the 3D tools to the list of tabs.

## Example: Making a Robot Wheel
### 1. Drawing a circle
Our first step in making a wheel is drawing its basic outline. of our wheel. We want our wheel to have a diameter of 3". Since this is a 2D shape, the "TOP" view will be the easiest to use. We then click anywhere on the
