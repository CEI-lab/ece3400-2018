## Tutorials and Helpful links

We have and will continue to upload helpful tutorials and links on this webpage. We would love for you to contribute, please contact the TA's to do this!

**Solutions**

Note that all labs have changed slightly, and no prior solutions are directly applicable to the current semester challenge.

[Team Alpha Repository](https://cei-lab.github.io/ECE3400-2017-teamAlpha/)

This is the repository for the team of TA's that solved all the labs during the Summer of 2017. Please use this website for support and inspiration; no credits will be given for close copies of these solutions. Also, the TA's were under strict timelines - hopefully you will upload more comprehensive and better websites over the course of the semester.

[2017 Team Websites](https://cei-lab.github.io/ece3400-2017/teams.html)

Also, check out this brief on [systems design](./Systems_design.md) early in the semester - it will help you prep for the final competition!

**Making Tutorials**

* Making tutorials is a great way to earn extra credit. Please confer with the professor _before_ starting. [Here's a brief tutorial on making tutorials](https://cei-lab.github.io/ece3400-2017/tutorials/tutorials.html), with a list of possible tutorials we'd like to add.
* Also, here is a fantastic [tutorial from Stanford on how to make interactive tutorials](http://www.redblobgames.com/making-of/line-drawing/)

**Related to Control**

* [Intro to Arduino IDE](https://cei-lab.github.io/ece3400-2017/tutorials/Arduino/Arduino_Intro.html)
* Hate the Arduino IDE? You're not alone. It was really made for beginners, and so often hinders more advanced developers. If you are willing to spend some extra hours getting up to speed, you may want to switch to the [Bare-Arduino-Project](https://github.com/ladislas/Bare-Arduino-Project). Be aware that there might be little help from the TAs if you choose this option.
* [Arduino Uno online references and tutorials](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage)
* [A useful script to report on the internal state of your Arduino](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/ShowInfo) and [here](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/ShowInfo?action=sourceblock&num=1)
* Also, for problems with Arduino, look at wiring.c on your development machine to see the firmware settings that are being uploaded to your Arduino.
* [Discussion of Source Code Compilation](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Build-Process).
* [Writing your own (basic) library for your robot by Chloe Kuo](https://pulse-3400.github.io/arduinolibrarytutorial/).
* [Intro to PWM (Lab1)](https://cei-lab.github.io/ece3400-2017/tutorials/PWM/PWM.html)
* [A Polulu library reference guide for line following](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J19/3). We will not be using the same line sensors, so the library wonâ€™t be installed/used directly. However, reading through the example will give you an idea of how PID control can be used for line following, particularly the command reference for readLine() and the bottom section on PID control.

**Related to Mechanical Fabrication:**

We have a Skunkworks dedicated to the class. This is located in PH414 and is equipped with a laser cutter, two 3D printers, two PCB mills and a PCB etching station (to come). Please be aware that you only get to use these machines after training, and only when TA's are present.
