SUB-PARTS

SPECIFIC GOALS

### Overview of Tasks

FIX EXAMPLE PROJECT

Both subteams will need one FPGA and one Arduino. Both teams should download the example Quartus project [here](https://github.com/rohern/ece3400/blob/master/lab3/Lab3_template.zip) and modify the top-level module DE0_NANO.v.

We are using a DE0-Nano Development Board. Its documentation can be found here: http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=165&No=593&PartNo=4.

### Documentation
Throughout this lab and ALL labs, remember to document your steps, experiences, and results on your website. Add anything that you think might be useful to the next person doing the lab. This may include helpful notes, code, schematics, diagrams, videos, and documentation of results and challenges of this lab. You will be graded on the thoroughness and readability of these websites. We cannot grade what isn't proven on the website.

Remember, all labs are mandatory; attendance will be taken at every lab. All labs will require you to split into two sub-teams, be sure to note on the website what work is carried out by whom. 

### Procedures

#### Task 1: Camera-to-FPGA

**1. Setup and Calibrate Camera:**

#### Task 2: FPGA-to-Arduino

**1. Make 25MHz clock:**

### Wrap-Up

Keep your Arduino Unos and Parallax servos in the box dedicated for your team. All other components can be placed back into their appropriate bins. Clean up your station thoroughly before you leave!

Use GitHub on the computer to upload and save your code, be sure to add appropriate commit messages. The lab computers will NOT keep any data locally (i.e., on them). Once you log off, the data will eventually be lost (typically overnight). Save your data on a flash drive or other means before you leave the lab.

### Grading

You need to document this lab thoroughly on your website, feel free to add ideas/comments this lab inspires regarding your future robot; the TA's will check the website by the deadline noted [here](./schedule.md). Note that to encourage concise and engaging websites, we have a cap on the number of words allowed to discuss lab 4: 3,000 (not including code snippets). You can easily make up for the lack of words by adding figures, photos, and videos with captions! Remember to have a TA note your attendance before heading out.
