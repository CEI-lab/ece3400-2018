## Course Description

Students will engage in a holistic design approach to Intelligent Physical Systems which can perceive, reason about, and act upon their environment. This course will expand on the ECE 2000-level courses, and include topics on algorithms, field programmable gate arrays, wireless communication, sensors, actuators, power, and mechanics. Students will learn the value and trade-offs between theory, simulation, and physical implementations, and gain familiarity with rapid prototyping techniques, system debugging, team work, leadership skills, time management, and how to disseminate work to a broader audience through webpages.

_Specific outcomes include:_
* The ability to apply specific design methodologies to the course project
* The ability to evaluate what problems are best solved in software, electronics, or mechanics; as well as the trade-offs between theory, simulation, and practical implementations.
* Efficient team work, as a member and as a leader.
* Effectively communication skills through online media.
* Awareness of professional and ethical responsibilities in the context of Intelligent Physical Systems.

Prerequisites include ECE 2100  ECE 2200 and ECE 2300.  Recommended prerequisite: ECE 2400 (or equivalent).
All information is gathered on this page; no additional textbooks are required.

## Semester Project

In teams of 5-7 people, you will design, fabricate, and program a robot to explore a maze. The robot microcontroller will be based on an Arduino Uno; the default propulsion method will be differential drive with continuous rotation servos. The robot will traverse the maze by following black lines on a white floor; it must also be able to detect walls, an audible start signal, and treasures emitting infrared light at different frequencies. The robot must continuously transmit its progress wirelessly to a base station (also based on Arduino Uno). This base station will communicate with an FPGA that in turn must drive a screen through a VGA interface. Points will be awarded for speed, accuracy, and innovative design methods. The entire robot can cost no more than $100; this [chart](Cost.md) shows how the price is calculated.

All designs must be documented throughout the semester on a group website. The goal is for these websites to be used as a source of reference for future classes. Accordingly, they will be graded with respect to thoroughness and clarity. However, to give teams a competitive advantage, we ask everyone to keep explicit code and circuit designs private until the end of the semester.

[Rules and final scoring chart](./Grading/Readme.md)

## Team Composition

The teams will be composed by the TA's and lecturer *without exception*.

Teams will be dependent on lab-time sign-up, student skillsets, and personalities. Before midnight August 23rd please fill out these [Google forms](https://goo.gl/forms/G54ZCPmXbgT65QS32) such that the teams can be formed immediately.

All labs are divided into two sub-labs. To ensure a good mix, it is required that you keep switching partners for the different labs. For example, if student A-F is a team; lab 1 should be solved by A-B-C and D-E-F; lab 2 by A-C-D and B-E-F; lab 3 by A-D-E and B-C-F; and lab 4 by A-E-F and B-C-D. Be sure to note what team members solve the sub labs on the website. 

We will host internal team evaluations and practice constructive critiscism. Receiving and giving profesional feedback may be uncomfortable at first, but it is a skill that will help you in any future career.

This [folder](./Grading/Readme.md) includes documents detailing how students will be graded. Be aware that a lot of changes has been made for Fall 2017 and that the score-chart may be changed throughout the semester.

**Solutions**

[Team Alpha Repository](https://cei-lab.github.io/ECE3400-2017-teamAlpha/)

This is the repository for the team of TA's that solved all the labs during the Summer of 2017. Please use this website for support and inspiration; no credits will be given for close copies of these solutions. Also, the TA's were under strict timelines - hopefully you will upload more comprehensive and better websites over the course of the semester.

* Also, for problems with Arduino, look at wiring.c on your development machine to see the firmware settings that are being uploaded to your Arduino.
* [Here's](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J19/3) a Polulu library reference guide for line following. We will not be using the same line sensors, so the library wonâ€™t be installed/used directly. However, reading through the example will give you an idea of how PID control can be used for line following, particularly the command reference for readLine() and the bottom section on PID control.

Please be aware that only TA's (and potentially trained students) will have access to this lab, but everyone can request to have pieces 3D printed, laser cut, or etched in there.
