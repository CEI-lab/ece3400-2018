### Instructor

![Kirstin](./images/Kirstin.png)
I am an assistant professor in ECE, with field appointments in ME and CS. I run the [Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab](http://cei.ece.cornell.edu/) with research on bio-inspired robot collectives. Feel free to contact me with any questions/concerns that don't fit Piazza. I have no specific office hours, but I intend to hang around PH427 in the beginning of many of the lab sessions. When I'm not designing random robots, I'm all about hiking, kayaking, camping, and getting as far from my computer as possible!

### TAs

![Ryan](./images/Ryan.png)
I am a second-year PhD student in ECE, working with Kirstin in the [Collective Embodied Intelligence Lab](http://cei.ece.cornell.edu/). I am a computer scientist by training, but a passion for building things brought me into ECE and robotics. You can ask me a question about any topic taught in the course. Outside of the lab I can be seen deadlifting in Teagle or on the mats with the Cornell Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Club.
