%% Milestone 3: Maze mapping simulation for ECE3400, Fall 2017
%  Implements a baseline depth-first-search navigation algorithm
%  Written by Claire Chen for EC3400  
%% Maze initializations

% Initialize current location maze array
% 1 means unvisited
% 0.5 means visited
% 0 is the robot's current location

curr_loc = [...
    1 1 1 1 
    1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1
    1 1 1 1 
    1 1 1 1];  

% Initialize array that keeps track of which grid spaces have been visited
visited_info = zeros(5,4);

% Set maze walls
% For each grid space, wall locations are represented with 4 bits:
% [bit3 bit2 bit1 bit0] ==> [W E S N]
% N (north wall) = 0001 in binary or 1 in decimal
% S (south wall) = 0010 in binary or 2 in decimal
% E (east wall)  = 0100 in binary or 4 in decimal
% W (west wall)  = 1000 in binary or 8 in decimal
% For example: A grid that has a wall to the north and east would have a
% wall location of 0101 in binary or 5 in decimal

% Some various wall configurations, for testing
% You can uncomment any of the wall_loc arrays or write your own mazes
