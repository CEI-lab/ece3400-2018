# TA sign-up sheets
## ECE 3400, Fall 2018

Expectation of workload, as per university policy:

* Undergraduate and MEng TAs will spend on average 8 hrs per week and max. 10 hours in a single week.
* Graduate TAs will spend on average 15 hrs per week and max. 20 hours in a single week.

1. All TAs must sign up to attend one of the weekly lab hours - we need exactly two TA's for every lab:

* Monday 1.25-4.25pm (Ryan, name)
* Monday 7.30-10pm (name, name)
* Wednesday 7.30-10pm (name, name)
* Thursday 7.30-10pm (name, name)
* Friday 1.25-4.25pm (name, name)

2. All TAs must sign up to grade at least one of the lab's (website), and one of the milestones (we need two TA's for every grading assignment):

* Lab 1 (name, name)
* Lab 2 (name, name)
* Lab 3 (name, name)
* Lab 4 (name, name)
* Milestone 1 (name, name)
* Milestone 2 (name, name)
* Milestone 3 (name, name)
* Milestone 4 (name, name)

3. No students are allowed in PH414/PH427 without a TA present, so we need lots of Open Lab hours (OH) with a couple of caveats. No more than two TAs should cover a single time slot. OHs during the weekend are encouraged. TAs are not expected to do OH during the two weeks where they grade. If you have weeks where you have no time for OH, feel free to catch up later. Specifically, we need lots of extra office hours Sept 4-9th (because of labor day), Oct 10th-14th (because of Fall break), and before and after Thanksgiving. It is very helpful for the students if you plan at least one week ahead for OH. 

* Mark open lab hours in the [Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ece34002017%40gmail.com&ctz=America/New_York) (with the password and username sent in a separate email).

4. All TAs must be present during the final competition December 4th.

5. Everyone needs to help give the final grades on December 5th

6. If you'd like to give a lecture, let Kirstin know at least two weeks in advance. Note that this takes considerable effort and preparation time, but looks great on your CV. Lecture topics can be sensors and signal processing, feedback control, mechanical prototyping, PCB design, wired communication, wireless communication, or FPGA coding.
